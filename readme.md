## Overview
**TL;DR.** Self-Rewarding SMC is an inference-time scaling method that leverages trajectory-level confidence from diffusion models as importance weights to steer generation toward globally confident, high-quality samples.

- Self-Rewarding SMC is **reward-free** and thus can be applied to arbitrary pretrained models and tasks!

In this repository, we provide evaluations on standard Masked Diffusion Language Models (**MDLMs**) including MDLM and BD3-LMs, and diffusion large language models (**dLLMs**) including LLaDA-1.5 and Dream-7B.

Each subdirectory contains model-specific configurations and scripts for running self-rewarding SMC at inference time.

As an example, run the following code for sample quality evaluation:

```
cd bd3lms
sh scripts/gen_ppl/genppls_batch.sh
```
